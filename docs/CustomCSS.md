# Custom CSS

**Since +debug35, the app has supported loading custom CSS for the main page.**

## To apply:

1. Tap on the 'Show Picker' button. A document picker view should appear.
1. Select your custom CSS file. The picker should close
1. Tap on the purple 'refresh' button in the bottom left corner
1. Refresh your browser window. The custom CSS should be immediately applied.

## To clear:

1. Tap on the 'Remove Custom CSS File' button
1. Tap on the purple 'refresh' button on the bottom left corner
1. Refresh your browser window. The CSS should be back to normal.

The CSS is persistent, so you can apply custom CSS, close the app, reopen it, and the custom CSS will still be in place when you start the server again.
