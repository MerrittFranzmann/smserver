# Custom CSS

**Since 0.1.0+debug35, the app (not the .deb, but source & .ipa) has supported loading custom CSS for the main page.**

## To apply:

1. Tap on the 'Set custom CSS' button. A document picker view should appear.
1. Select your custom CSS file. The picker should close
1. Tap on the purple 'refresh' button in the bottom left corner
1. Refresh your browser window. The custom CSS should be immediately applied.

## To clear:

1. Tap on the 'Trash' button next to the 'Set custom CSS'
1. Tap on the purple 'refresh' button on the bottom left corner
1. Refresh your browser window. The CSS should be back to normal.

The CSS is persistent, so you can apply custom CSS, close the app, reopen it, and the custom CSS will still be in place when you start the server again.

Also, there is now an easy option in settings to change the web interface theme from dark to light; however, they are not perfectly accurate to stock colors so if you are very particular, I would recommend making your own CSS file.
