# FAQ

### I have the server running, but can't connect to it.
There are a few things you should check:
1. Have you made sure to install all of the dependencies (specifically `libsmserver` and `libMRYIPC`)?
1. Did you start the server with the green button on the bottom left of the app?
1. Are you connecting to the right address with regard to using `https://` vs `http://`?
1. Are your host and client devices on the same LAN/WLAN networks?
1. Did you verify that neither device's firewall is blocking the connection?

If you can answer 'yes' to all the above questions, feel free to file an issue in the `Issues` tab above.

### The app is crashing when I click on a conversation in the left-hand side of the web interface

Try disabling 'Mark conversations as read when viewed on web interface' in the settings of the app, restarting the app, and try again. If it still crashes, feel free to file an issue.
